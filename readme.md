## Framing

The files we’ll be working with in this lesson are highlighted in blue below:

## We Do: Set Up a Rails Application (10 minutes / 0:10)

Run the below command in Terminal to create a new Rails application...  

```bash
$ rails new tunr -d postgresql
```
> `-d postgresql` is important! It tells our application that we will be using postgres as our database. Otherwise, Rails uses SQLite as a database by default.  

This creates 92 new files in a directory called `tunr`. We can easily keep track of what files have changed if we use version control...  

```bash
$ cd tunr
$ git init
$ git add .
$ git commit -m "initial commit"
```
> How can you tell if 92 new files were created? Try running `find . -type f | wc -l` in the Terminal.  

Let's explore some of the files that were created...  

### `tunr/config/database.yml`

Specifies the database connection options. By default, rails uses the development options detailed in this file.  

To create the database, run `rake db:create` in the Terminal. How can we tell this actually created the database? Run these three commands separately in the Terminal...

* `$ rails c`
* `$ psql -d tunr_development`
* `$ rails dbconsole`

Use `rails c` to view the output of...  

```rb
ENV["RAILS_ENV"]
```
> You can see that the output is `development`. ENV["RAILS_ENV"] is a way we get/set our environment and allows for different types of configurations. The other two types of environment are `test` and `production`  

#### What is Rake?

**Rake** is a ruby implementation of Make. **Make** is a popular tool that allows developers to put repetitive command line tasks into a single file and run several tasks at the same time
with a single command.  

Rails uses rake to...
* Create the database (`rake db:create`)
* Create / Edit database tables (`rake db:migrate`)
* Drop the database (`rake db:drop`)
* Seed the database (`rake db:seed`)

[Learn more about Rake here](https://github.com/ruby/rake#description).  

## You Do: Models (10 minutes / 0:20)

**[5 minutes]** Create Artist and Song models the same way you did in last week's Active Record class. They should...
* Have the appropriate file name.
* Have the appropriate model name.
* Inherit from Active Record.
* Indicate the appropriate relationships.
> In this application, a song belongs to an artist.  

You will be placing these files into the `app/models` directory of your Rails application.  

How do you know it worked? If we hop into the rails console and type in Artist...  

```bash
$ rails c
```

You should then see something like...  

```text
Loading development environment (Rails 4.2.4)
2.2.3 :001> Artist
 => Artist(Table doesn't exist)
```
> If we type in any other capitalized word it will throw an error `uninitialized Constant`  

## We Do: Migrations (15 minutes / 0:35)

> AM: Ask Andy how he kicks off this section.  

<!-- ALB: This line doesn't make much sense to me, I feel like
    the term new version is confusing. I'd favor an anology of a step in a recipe.

    The set of migrations is the recipe, each migration file is a step in that recipe.

    Running the migrations 'follows the steps in the recipe'
 -->

A migration as being a new "version" of the database.
* A schema starts off with nothing in it, and each migration modifies it to add/remove tables, columns or entries.
* Active Record knows how to update your schema along this timeline, bringing it from whatever point it is in the history to the latest version.
* Active Record will also update your db/schema.rb file to match the up-to-date structure of your database.
> An extensive description of Rails migrations can be found [http://edgeguides.rubyonrails.org/active_record_migrations.html](here).

In the terminal...

```bash
$ rails g migration create_artists
```
> `rails g` is short for `rails generate`.  

This creates a migration file `db/migrate/20150726145027_create_artists.rb`. Let's see what it looks like...  

> AM: Insert screenshot of migration file?  
<!-- ALB: I don't think it's necessary personally -->


The numbers at the beginning of a migration file are a timestamp.
* Rails uses this timestamp to determine which migration should be run and in what order, so if you're copying a migration from another application or generate a file yourself, be aware of its position in the order.
> [Source](http://edgeguides.rubyonrails.org/active_record_migrations.html#creating-a-standalone-migration)  

<!-- ALB: the above link renders on the same paragraph in HTML, so looks funny. -->

```rb
class CreateArtists < ActiveRecord::Migration
  def change
    create_table :artists do |t|
    end
  end
end
```
The above file, as is, defines a new table called `artists`.
* Now we need to define what columns are going to appear in this table. We'll do this inside of the `create_table` method...

```rb
class CreateArtists < ActiveRecord::Migration
  def change
    create_table :artists do |t|
      t.string :name
      t.string :photo_url
      t.string :nationality
    end
  end
end
```

How are we defining columns in `create_table`?
* We use `t` to indicate the table we are creating inside of the code block.
* We then use methods like `.string` or `.integer` to represent the data types of the columns we are creating.
* These methods take in a symbol argument (e.g., `:photo_url`) that represents the name of the column.

You can create the `artists` table and run this migration by entering the following into the terminal...

```bash
$ rake db:migrate
```

After running this, a file called `db/schema.rb` is generated. What are it's contents?

> You should NEVER have to update the `schema.rb`. Running `rake db:migrate` will update the schema for you using migration files.  

## You Do: View `db/schema.rb` (5 minutes / 0:40)

**[1 minute]** Read through this new file.

> AM: Add discussion/questions about what people see in there.  

## You Do: Use Rails Console (5 minutes / 0:45)

**[2 minutes]** Enter the Rails Console and create two Artists.
* You can do this using the Active Record methods you learned in earlier classes.
> Remember, you can enter the Rails Console by typing `rails c` into the Terminal.

## You Do: Songs Migration (10 minutes / 0:55)

**[5 minutes]** Create a migration file for a new `songs` table.  

To associate one model with another in a migration file, you can include one of the following methods in the `create_table` method. They all do pretty much the same thing, with a few differences...

* `t.belongs_to :artist`
* `t.references :artist`
* `t.integer :artist_id`

> AM: Need to add more info on these three different techniques.  

## Break (10 minutes / 1:05)

## I Do: Passing Arguments Into `rails g migration` (10 minutes / 1:15)

We can use the Terminal to create an entire migration file -- column names and data types included -- in one command.

```
$ rails g migration create_songs title:string album:string preview_url:string artist:references
```
> There are lots of little short cuts that `g` or `generate` can give you. [Model Generators](http://edgeguides.rubyonrails.org/active_record_migrations.html#model-generators) are just one example.  

The above command creates the following file...  

```rb
# db/migrate/20150726150324_create_songs.rb

class CreateSongs < ActiveRecord::Migration
  def change
    create_table :songs do |t|
      t.string :title
      t.string :album
      t.string :preview_url
      t.references :artist, index: true, foreign_key: true
    end
  end
end
```

What do we see?
* `references` is used when the column represents a foreign key for another table. It appears
wherever `belongs_to` appears in the model definition.
* `t.references :artist` is equivalent to `t.integer :artist_id`
> What is [`index: true`?](http://rny.io/rails/postgresql/2013/08/20/postgresql-indexing-in-rails.html)

## You Do: Rails Console (5 minutes / 1:20)

**[2 minutes]** Use Rails Console to create at least three songs that are associated with the previous two artists.  
> Make a mental note of the commands you use to do this.  

## We Do: Seeds (10 minutes / 1:30)

Seeds allow us to quickly create dummy data. Why would we do that?
* In order to test out the interfaces and functionalities we build out, we need some content/data to manipulate in order to see how it looks and feels on our application.

Let's update our seeds (`db/seeds.rb`) file now.
* Write out the same Active Record commands you used in the Rails Console to create three Artists and three Songs.
* Make sure to include the following two lines of code at the very top of your `db/seeds.rb`...

```rb
Artist.destroy_all
Song.destroy_all
```

To run `db/seeds.rb` all we need to do is run `$ rake db:seed` in the Terminal.  

After running the seeds, go into the `rails console` and play with the objects you created.  

## We Do: Adding Timestamps (10 minutes / 1:40)

Rails can automatically timestamp when objects are created and updated. Let’s create a new migration to add timestamp columns to the artists table.

```bash
$ rails g migration add_timestamps_to_artists
```

In that migration place the following content:

```rb
# 20150726150946_add_timestamps_to_artists.rb
class AddTimestampsToArtists < ActiveRecord::Migration
  def change
    add_column :artists, :created_at, :datetime
    add_column :artists, :updated_at, :datetime
  end
end
```

`add_column`. **What's that?**
* It's one of many custom methods that can be used in the `change` method in migrations.
* It takes 3 arguments.
  1. The table you want to add the column to.  
  2. The column you'd like to add to that table.  
  3. The column's data type.  

## You Do: Add Timestamps to the Songs Table (5 minutes / 1:45)

**[3 minutes]** Apply what we just learned to the `songs` table.

## Break (10 minutes / 1:55)

## I Do: Undoing Things

### The Wrong Way (10 minutes / 2:05)

Lets assume you have this migration...

```rb
class CreateArtists < ActiveRecord::Migration
  def change
    create_table :artists do |t|
      t.string :name
      t.string :poto_url
      t.string :nationality
    end
  end
end
```

We really messed this migration up by misspelling `:photo_url`. But oh no, we've already run our migrations! What do we do?  

We could directly modify this migration file and run `rake db:migrate`.
* But if we then look at `db/schema.rb`, however, we see that nothing has changed. It still says `poto_url`.

What about resetting the entire database via the Terminal?  

```bash
$ rake db:drop
$ rake db:create
$ rake db:migrate
```

If we run these commands, we're dropping our entire database and creating a brand new one.
* Why is this potentially super dangerous?

Another (wrong) way we can do this is by using `rake db:rollback`.
* To undo a single migration, run `rake db:rollback` in the Terminal.
* Be careful though -- this might destroy data! Whatever columns or tables that were created by that migration will now be gone.  

> Running `rake db:rollback` will only undo the migration with the most recent timestamp. Every subsequent rollback will undo the most recent timestamped migration that hasn't been undone yet.  

It is considered **OK** to rollback migrations, edit them and re-migrate in a development environment, but **NOT** in a production environment.
* If you are working on an application with other developers, avoid using `rake db:rollback` after code has been pushed, and create new migrations that can be migrated forward on other machines.

A common theme here is that if you're not working alone in development, destroying data is bad.
* It's sometimes not obvious what actions you take may or may not destroy user data. Know that `rake db:rollback` and `rake db:drop` have the potential of doing it.

### You Do: Create a Migration and Roll It Back (5 minutes / 2:10)

* Create a migration that adds a column to artist called `genre` that has a string as the data type
* Run the migrations by running `$ rake db:migrate`
* Inspect `db/schema.rb`. Look at its contents.
* Now run rake db:rollback
* Inspect `db/schema.rb` again and note that `genre` is not longer a column in the table.
* Spend two minutes experimenting for yourself how `$ rake db:rollback` works


### I Do: The Right Way (10 minutes / 2:20)

Let's assume we did mess up our initial migration like the code above with the misspelled `poto_url`. Instead of the methods listed above, the right way is to create an additional migration that changes the name of the column in our table.  

In the terminal...  

```bash
$ rails g migration change_column_in_artists
```

This will generate a new migration. Lets fill its contents now in `db/migrate/20151105201357_change_column_in_artists.rb`...

```rb
class ChangeColumnInArtists < ActiveRecord::Migration
  def change
    rename_column :artists, :poto_url, :photo_url
  end
end
```

`rename_column` is another method we can use inside `change`.
* It takes 3 arguments as well...
  1. The table for which you want to rename a column.  
  2. The current name of the column you'd like to change.  
  3. The new name of the column.  

Now if we run our migrations, we can see that the artists table in `db/schema.rb` has the proper `:photo_url` column. Although this process takes a bit more legwork, we don't run the risk of destroying databases or undoing migrations.
